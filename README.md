# hobby-WPF-EFCore-IBP-PhoneModels
Demo with usage of WPF, EFCore v6.0 and IBProvider

It's an elementary application for editing a database with single table - PHONE. Just for fun.

Techonlogies:
 - WPF
 - EntityFrameworkCore v6
 - Lcpi.EntityFrameworkCore.DataProvider.LcpiOleDb
 - LCPI.IBProvider.5

Some "advanced" features weren't implemented but, I'm sure, for the first application it's more than enough :)
